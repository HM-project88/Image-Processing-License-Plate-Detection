This program use for detecting Iranian car plate number which includes two parts:
1- Training: For running you should run the "Program_Train.m" and the data 
which uses for training is inside the Image "Input.jpg". This Image has all 
characters which use in Iranian car plate number.
2- Testing: For running you should run the "Program.m" and the result will show. 
I used an Image which is called "Image1.jpg" for testing the program.
An artificial neural network was used for detecting the car plate number.
